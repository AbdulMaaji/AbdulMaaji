# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Maaji
Full‑stack tinkerer — I build beautiful, responsive frontends with HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript, craft interactive UIs with React.js, and power robust backends with Django. I love turning ideas into polished, maintainable apps.

---

🚀 Quick snapshot
- Frontend: HTML5 · CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, animations) · JavaScript (ES6+) · React.js (hooks, context, router)
- Backend: Django · Django REST Framework · PostgreSQL · Authentication & API design
- Focus: Responsive UI, accessible components, clean architecture, and fast UX

---

What I build
- Interactive single‑page apps with React for smooth user experiences
- Clean, semantic HTML & modern CSS for pixel‑perfect, responsive layouts
- RESTful APIs and admin dashboards using Django and Django REST Framework
- Full‑stack projects that connect React frontends to Django backends securely

---

Highlights — what I'm proud of
- User‑first UI: accessible, keyboard‑friendly components and good mobile performance
- Component-driven frontends: reusable React components and clear state management
- Scalable backends: well‑structured Django projects with modular apps and tested endpoints
- Dev workflow: Git, code reviews, and CI-friendly practices
